## ðŸŽ¯ Stock Recommendations

**Investment Suggestions:**

- **Nvidia (NVDA)**: Nvidia, despite recent corrections, is considered undervalued with a strong growth potential. It trades at a low valuation relative to its expected earnings growth, making it a good long-term investment. However, there is risk associated with tech sector volatility and sector-wide corrections.
  
- **CVS Health (CVS)**: CVS Health is a top performer in the S&P 500 this year, offering a stable and diversified healthcare business. It has a solid economic moat and improving balance sheet strength, making it a stable long-term investment. Risks include low switching costs between pharmacies and potential regulatory challenges.

**Stock to Sell:**

- **Tesla (TSLA)**: Tesla has seen significant declines in the market, with a performance drop of 35.8% this year. While it has strong brand recognition, its valuation and continued high volatility make it challenging to hold without significant upside potential.
